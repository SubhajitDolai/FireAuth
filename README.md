# FireAuth

**FireAuth** is a Flutter app demonstrating Firebase Authentication integration. This app features a modern, minimalistic UI with two pages: a login page and a "register now" page. The project showcases email/password authentication and Google Sign-In/Log-In. It's built as a demo to highlight my learning journey with Flutter and Firebase.

## Features

- **Email/Password Authentication**: Users can register with their email and password or log in if they already have an account.
- **Google Sign-In/Log-In**: Simplifies the login process using Google accounts.
- **Modern, Minimal UI**: A clean, user-friendly interface that ensures a seamless user experience.
